# Wasserstein Robust Optimization
Starter pack for distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization using the Wasserstein distance. This is specifically an unofficial implementation of the equivalent chance-constraint reformulation referenced in the following paper:

C. Duan, W. Fang, L. Jiang, L. Yao and J. Liu, "Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Approximate AC-OPF With Wasserstein Metric," in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 33, no. 5, pp. 4924-4936, Sept. 2018, doi: 10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2807623.

# Installation

Consider the following steps to install this directory, and get started solving your own distributionally robust optimization programs:

1. clone repository
2. Navigate to the root directory and run the following commands:\
   a. pip install -r requirements.txt\
   b. pip install -e .

Now you're ready to get started running code!

To test the DRO reformulation algorithm, use the script "vectorExample.py" already included in the repo.
